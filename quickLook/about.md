# About

Hello, I am Sawaiz... autodidact... that probably covers it well. I am out to learn and do all I can. I have countless projects in progress, and things I learn for or from one, always seem to come in handy. I am highly opinionated and always willing to argue to come to the *right* consensus.

I live in Alpharetta, GA a suburb of Atlanta and work as the lead hardware developer for Georgia State University's Nuclear Physics department. I am designing the mRICH detector for the future EIC project, testing and assembly for sPHENIX, and constructing detectors for cosmic ray measurement and education.

If I'm not working, I have my own projects to tend to, my insanely long list of shows to catch up on, photography, and playing board games with friends.
